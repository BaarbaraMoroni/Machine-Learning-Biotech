# Project-Machine-Learning-Biotech  
# Genetic Syndrome Classification using Machine Learning  

This project is a Machine Learning test for Apollo Solutions. The objective is to classify genetic syndromes from image embeddings using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Euclidean and Cosine distance metrics. The project includes t-SNE visualizations, cross-validation, and performance metrics such as AUC and F1-Score.

## **Prerequisites**  
- Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed and `pip` configured in the PATH. To check, run:  
```bash
python --version
pip --version

```
- Dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn fpdf pickle-mixin
```

## **Script Execution Order**
for direct pipeline execution:
```bash
python main.py
```
or
to execute in stages: 
```bash

cd scripts
python data_processing.py
python exploratory_data_analysis.py
python visualization.py
python classification.py
python metrics_evaluation.py
python report_generator.py
```
# **Project Description**

# **data/**
This folder contains the input data and processed files:

- mini_gm_public_v0.1.p: Pickle file with image embeddings.
- flattened_data.pkl: Flattened DataFrame generated during preprocessing.
⚠️ Note: The mini_gm_public_v0.1.p file must be placed in this folder before running the scripts.
---

# **scripts/**
This folder contains all the Python scripts required to run the Machine Learning pipeline:

Modular Scripts:
- data_processing.py: Loads and preprocesses the data.
- exploratory_data_analysis.py: Exploratory analysis and visualization of syndrome distribution.
- visualization.py: Dimensionality reduction with t-SNE and cluster visualization.
- classification.py: Classification with KNN using Euclidean and Cosine metrics.
- metrics_evaluation.py: Performance evaluation and generation of ROC AUC curves.
- report_generator.py: Generates the PDF report with graphs and analysis.
  
# **visuals/**
This folder stores the graphs generated during the pipeline execution:
- distribuicao_sindromes.png: Syndrome distribution in the dataset.
- tsne_visualization.png: t-SNE visualization of the embeddings clusters.
- roc_auc_euclidean.png: ROC AUC curve for the Euclidean metric.
- roc_auc_cosine.png: ROC AUC curve for the Cosine metric.
  
⚠️ Note: Graphs are automatically saved here during execution.

# **results/**
This folder was included to save intermediate tables or metrics, but it was not used in this project.
- It can be used for future experiments or additional analyses.

# **report/**
Contains the final PDF report generated by the project:
- classification_report.pdf: Report with methodology, results, graphs, and analysis.
- The report is automatically generated by the report_generator.py script.
